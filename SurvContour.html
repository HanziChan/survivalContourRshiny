<p>We provide SurvivalContour to show the predicted survival or
cumulative incidence function (for competing risks data) over time for a
single continuous covariate in the form of a contour plot. The estimate
for survival probability is based on the Cox model, random survival
forest or other parametric survival models, including the spline model,
the generalized Gamma AFT model, the stable generalized Gamma AFT model,
the Weibull AFT model, the log-logistic AFT model, and the log-Normal
AFT model. The estimate for cumulative incidence function is based on
the Fine and Gray model. For more complex deep neural network based
models, such as DeepHit, due to the intricacy of manual tuning, we have
not included them in this R Shiny app. Instead, we suggest users check
out our easy-to-use R package, <a href="https://yushushi.shinyapps.io/survivalContour/">survivalContour</a>.</p>

For more details, please check our paper **SurvivalContour: Show Survival Prediction in Contour Plot**. We also provide an R package <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aPCoA/index.html>.

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>After successfully loading the data, the shiny app will ask you to
choose the time variable, event indicator variable, and the main
continuous covariate for plotting the contour plot. We will ask you to
specify the range of time and covariate for plotting the predicted
survival or the probability of having the primary event. Users can
select their preferred color scheme from a few popular choices, define
the name of the continuous variable shown in the plot, and specify if
they want to plot the confidence interval for 3D contour plot. Users can
also adjust for other covariates but need to provide 1) whether the
covariates are continuous; 2) the values on which the contour plot for
the predicted survival is based.</p>

<h2>Plot result in R shiny app</h2>
<p>After clicking the button “Create Plots”, the R shiny app will
automatically produce the colored 2D and 3D contour plots of the
predicted survival probability (or probability of having the primary
event in competing risks data scenario). It will provide the regression
coefficient estimates and p-values for the continuous covariate of
interest as well as those adjusted covariates. It will also give the
estimated survival or cumulative incidence function at 5 quantiles of
the covariate. Due to the current limitation of the underlying packages,
we do not provide pointwise 95% confidence interval estimates for
competing risks data. Users can download the contour plot and survival
(CIF) plots with the plotting information.</p>
