<p>We provide SurvivalContour to show the predicted survival or
cumulative incidence function (for competing risks data) over time for a
single continuous covariate in the form of a contour plot. The estimate
for the survival probability is based on the Cox model, the spline
model, random survival forest, or parametric survival models, including
the generalized Gamma AFT model, the stable generalized Gamma AFT model,
the Weibull AFT model, the log-logistic AFT model, and the log-Normal
AFT model. The estimate for the cumulative incidence function is based
on the Fine-Gray model. For more complex deep neural network-based
models, such as DeepHit, due to the intricacy of manual tuning, we
suggest users check out our easy-to-use R package, <a href="https://github.com/YushuShi/survivalContour">survivalContour</a>.</p>
<div id="options" class="section level2">
<h2>Options</h2>
<p>After successfully loading the data, the Shiny app will ask the user
to choose the time variable, event indicator variable, and the main
continuous covariate for plotting the contour plot. We will ask the user
to specify the range of time and covariate values for plotting the
predicted survival or the probability of having the primary event. Users
can select their preferred color scheme from a few popular choices,
define the name of the continuous variable shown in the plot, and
specify if they want to plot the confidence interval for the 3D contour
plot. Users can also adjust for other covariates but need to provide 1)
whether the covariates are continuous, and 2) the values on which the
contour plot for the predicted survival is based.</p>

<h2>Plot result in R Shiny app</h2>
<p>After clicking the button “Create Plots”, the R Shiny app will
automatically produce the colored 2D and 3D contour plots of the
predicted survival probability (or probability of having the primary
event in the competing risks scenario). It will provide the regression
coefficient estimates and p-values for the continuous covariate of
interest as well as those for the covariates being adjusted for. It will
also give the estimated survival or cumulative incidence function at
five quantiles of the covariate. Due to the current limitation of the
underlying packages, we do not provide pointwise 95% confidence interval
estimates for competing risks data. Users can then download the contour
and survival (CIF) plots.</p>
