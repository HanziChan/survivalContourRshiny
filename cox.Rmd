The Shiny app has accommodated several survival models, including the Cox model, the spline model, the generalized Gamma AFT model, the stable generalized Gamma AFT model, the Weibull AFT model, the log-logistic  AFT model, and the log-Normal AFT model. The number of knots in the spline model is set to be 4. For parametric AFT models, covariates are placed on the “location'' parameter of the distribution, typically the "scale" or "rate" parameter, through a linear model, or a log-linear model if this parameter must be positive.

## Cox model example

This Veterans’ Administration Lung Cancer dataset is a classic survival analysis dataset imported from the R package "survival". For the purpose of illustration, we only keep observations using the standard treatment. The continuous covariate Karnofsky performance score (100=good) is a strong predictor of the survival result. There are 69 samples in this example dataset and the event times range from 3 to 553 days with a median of 97.

Here is the result for the veterans’ administration lung cancer dataset.

## Interval censored data

The Cox model can handle interval-censored data.

## Notice on the confidence interval

We provide 95% pointwise confidence interval for the predicted survival curves at 5 quantiles of the continuous covariate.
